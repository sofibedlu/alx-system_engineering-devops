Now that you’ve parsed the Apache log file, let’s sort the data so you can get a better idea of what is going on.

Using what you did in the previous exercise, write a Bash script that groups visitors by IP and HTTP status code, and displays this data.

Requirements:

The exact format must be:
OCCURENCE_NUMBER IP HTTP_CODE
In list format
Ordered from the greatest to the lowest number of occurrences
See example
You must use awk
You are not allowed to use while, for, until and cut
